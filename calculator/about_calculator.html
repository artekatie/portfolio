<h3>This is an outcome of my at home html/css/javascript learning process from online tutorials.</h3>
            <p>Some more complicated bits were written under a professional developer supervision. To do the calculation I have used this <a href="http://www.smccd.net/accounts/hasson/C++2Notes/ArithmeticParsing.html">algoritm</a> so this calculator, I hope, should work across all mathematics combination you may imagine.</p>
            <p>There is still a lot of work to do. Check all this stuff out and enjoy!</p>

            <p>If you have any questions, feedback or bug reports, I appreciate if you'll contact me</p>
